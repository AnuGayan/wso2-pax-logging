/**
* This is an adaptation of the Jakarta Commons Logging API for
* OSGi usage.
* <p>
* The LogFactory, LogConfigurationException and Log classes are exported from
* the Commons-Logging bundle, and will be provided to the bundles that import
* the commons-logging classes. And this class will either bind to a plain OSGi
* LogService, or if the Log4J service is detected, it will use that one
* instead.
* </p>
* <p>
* The bundle that uses this library to get Jakarta Commons Logging to bind to
* any of the supported backend logging systems, must import these classes
* and also enable the proper usage in its bundle activator. Typical code looks
* like this;
* <code><pre>
* import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;
* import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
*
* import org.ops4j.pax.logging.providers.LogProvider;
* import org.ops4j.pax.logging.providers.Log4JProvider;
*
* public class Activator
*     implements BundleActivator
* {
*     public void start( BundleContext context )
*         throws Exception
*     {
*         LogFactory factory = LogFactory.getInstance();
*         factory.setBundleContext( context );
*         Log4JProvider provider = new Log4JProvider( context );
*         factory.setProvider( provider );
*     }
*
*     public void stop( BundleContext context )
*     {
*         LogFactory factory = LogFactory.getInstance();
*         factory.release();
*     }
* }
* </pre></code>
* </p>
* <p>Factory for creating {@link Log} instances, with discovery and
* configuration features similar to that employed by standard Java APIs
* such as JAXP.</p>
