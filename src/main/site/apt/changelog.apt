Changes in 0.9.0
    If you have not used previous versions of Pax Logging, you can skip this section.

    Pax Logging v 0.9.x is again somewhat incompatible with previous pre-releases.
    Here is a list of changes that has happened in ver 0.9.x so far.

    * The previous pax-logging-client jar file no longer exist, and must be removed
      from clients using Pax Logging ver 0.9.x.

    * Each legacy API now resides in its own bundle. For support of the legacy API,
      just load that bundle.

    * The Service bundle can now be reloaded without shutting down the clients, as
      the API bundle contain a tracker.

    * The Activator in the client bundle, no longer need to bother with setting the
      bundle context in the APIs.

Changes in 0.9.5

    * Legacy API bundles has been folded into the API bundle, so that all legacy
      APIs are always available.
