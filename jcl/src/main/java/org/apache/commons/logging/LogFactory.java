 * The client code that wishes to use this adaptation of Jakarta Commons Logging and have the log output

 * <ul>
 * <li>ensure that commons-logging.jar is <b>NOT</b> included in your bundle jar.</li>
 * <li>include the pax-logging-client.jar into the client bundle.</li>
 * <li>update your Manifest.MF to import the org.ops4j.pax.logging package.</li>
